## UMEats - Free Food Management System

**UMEats** is an innovative Free Food Management System designed to reduce food waste and promote sustainability within the University of Malaya campus. The system is developed in collaboration with the **UM Zero Waste Campaign (UMZWC)**, a longstanding initiative dedicated to achieving a zero-waste campus through sustainable waste management practices.

### Overview

University campuses often generate significant food waste, especially after various festivals and events. In many cases, leftover food is discarded or goes unutilized due to lack of awareness and coordination. **UMEats** addresses this issue by creating a platform where free food can be effectively shared and utilized, ensuring that surplus food reaches students in need rather than being wasted.

### Key Features

1. **Add Meal**: Students and staff can donate leftover food by adding it to the UMEats system. They simply need to specify the location and quantity of the food available. This ensures that surplus food is recorded and made accessible to others.

2. **Take Meal**: Students can check the availability of free food across different residential blocks. They can then select and claim the food based on the quantity they need, up to a limit of four meals per request. This feature helps in distributing food efficiently to those who need it.

3. **Real-time Statistics**: UMEats provides real-time statistics on the number of available and served meals. This transparency helps in understanding the food waste situation on campus and encourages more participation in the initiative.

### How It Works

- **Select Area and Block**: Users can select their residential area and block from predefined options. This categorization helps in accurately locating the food and ensures a systematic distribution process.
- **Meal Quantity Management**: When adding a meal, users input the quantity of food they wish to donate. Similarly, when taking a meal, users can specify the quantity they need within a defined limit. The system updates the meal count accordingly, ensuring an up-to-date record of food availability.

### Benefits

- **Reduces Food Waste**: By providing a structured platform for sharing leftover food, UMEats significantly reduces food waste on campus.
- **Promotes Sustainability**: Aligning with the UM Zero Waste Campaign, UMEats fosters a culture of sustainability and responsible resource management.
- **Supports Students**: The system ensures that surplus food reaches students who need it, providing an additional resource for those who may face food insecurity.

### Code Example

### Conclusion

**UMEats** is a crucial step towards sustainable living on campus, encouraging the responsible use of resources and reducing food waste. By participating in UMEats, the University of Malaya community can contribute to a greener, more sustainable future while supporting their fellow students.
